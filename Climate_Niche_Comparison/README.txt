#Climatic niche analysis comparing A. villosa var. aurita and A. villosa var. villosa

#All code is in R and uses combined occurrence data from GBIF and CCH2
# which has been manually pruned for erroneous occurrences (A_vil_aur_combine.csv, A_vil_vil_combine.csv)

#Start with Abronia_bioclim_points_EA.R, either of the other scripts
# (Abronia_ecospat_statistical_tests.R, Abronia_niceOverPlot.R) can be performed next

#Please read the in-code annotations!
