Climatic Niche Analysis and Range Asymmetry Analysis comparing A. villosa var. aurita and A. villosa var. villosa

All code is in R and uses combined occurrence data from GBIF and CCH2
which has been manually pruned for erroneous occurrences (A_vil_aur_combine.csv, A_vil_vil_combine.csv)

For Climate Niche Analysis:
Start with Abronia_bioclim_points_EA.R, either of the other scripts
(Abronia_ecospat_statistical_tests.R, Abronia_niceOverPlot.R) can be performed next

For Range Asymmetry Analysis:

Please read the in-code annotations!
