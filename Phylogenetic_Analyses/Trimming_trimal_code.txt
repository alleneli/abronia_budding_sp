#All alignments were categorized into three groups based
# on a visual assessment of the problematic regions:
# bad = matrices with multiple problematic regions, 
# questionable = matrices with few problematic regions, 
# and good = matrices with no problematic regions. 
# 218 were marked as good, 61 as questionable, and 66 as bad.
